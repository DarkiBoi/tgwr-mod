 ###Events
 ww1_serbia.1.t:0 "Grand Coalition Collapsed"
 ww1_serbia.1.d:0 "Not even a month after the crisis has started, all ministers except the prime minister and foreign minister have resigned. As the coalition's life duration was already extended past all due points, it was only a matter of time for this experiment to fail, especially considering the calming of the region. While independent radicals expect new elections as it should've happened in 1908, the radical party has a relatively comfortable majority in parliament and can form a homogenous government. As the king refused to give the mandate to Pašić again, a homogenous government will be formed by Milovan Milovanović, the former foreign minister that will be merging his role with prime minister one for the duration of his mandate..."
 ww1_serbia.1.a:0 "Best outcome of the crisis"
 ww1_serbia.2.t:0 "Elections of 1912"
 ww1_serbia.2.d:0 "Elections are being held today. Most of the lists run separate although in some places there is formed some kind of anti-radical coalition consisting of National and Progressive parties. Elections are being held in the relatively new circumstances considering our new relations with Bulgaria and inevitable war that will the winner government wage against Ottoman Empire. As of now there is 5 lists, 2 radical lists that as always take the most votes, old Obrenović's parties and the new Socialdemocratic party that will for the first time open electoral posts in villages as well. As always, radical lists took most votes but it is question which radical party took more..."
 ww1_serbia.2.a:0 "The People's Radical Party"
 ww1_serbia.2.b:0 "The Independent Radical Party"
 ww1_serbia.3.t:0 "Dissident group of Radical deputies formed in parliament"
 ww1_serbia.3.d:0 "Seeing our switch in foreign policy, small group of 5 deputies from People's Radical Party stated together that they can not and will not tolerate the new switch in foreign policy. Therefore they stopped supporting the government and were thus kicked out of the party. But with them leaving Radical Party is left in very dangerous situation, as they are one deputy short of majority, having 79 deputies in support of the government out of 160 deputies in parliament total. We can expect motion of no confidence at any point from now on and only our prime minister's actions in placating the opposition parties can prolong the government's mandate in this situation of lost majority, and with alliance with Bulgaria in formation, government crash is the last thing we need."
 ww1_serbia.4.t:0 "Government Crisis!"
 ww1_serbia.4.d:0 "Independent Radicals had long restrained from calling off the confidence vote, mainly because of uncertain political situation in the region and the formation of alliance with Bulgaria. But as of now, alliance with Bulgaria had only became matter of time and situation in region has started to stabilize, they decided that now is the best time to call off the motion, especially since parliament's mandate would've been ending relatively soon. As People's Radical government was already in minority, government had no way for surviving the motion and therefore resigned as whole. We must now choose new government and king Peter was fast enough to suggest..."
 ww1_serbia.4.a:0 "...Ljubomir Stojanović from opposition party"
 ww1_serbia.5.t:0 "Stojanović rejects mandate"
 ww1_serbia.5.d:0 "After consultations with king Peter I, Ljubomir Stojanović refused to form government if Stepa Stepanović was the army minister. We have options to pressure him to form the temporary government without the minister or to just form radical government and dissolve assembly. Both governments would've been in technical mandate considering how regular elections would've been relatively soon and as soon as elections are over we were already planning to go for liberation of the Balkan Peninsula from 5 centuries of Turkish rule."
 ww1_serbia.5.a:0 "Form homogenous Radical government and dissolve assembly"
 ww1_serbia.5.b:0 "Pressure Stojanović into forming the caretaker government"
 ww1_serbia.6.t:0 "Stojanović resigns from government"
 ww1_serbia.6.d:0 "Prime minister [FROM.GetLeader] has, after big discussion of the new path for government decided that he can't support his party's opinion anymore. Therefore he resigned from both the government and the party appointing as successor former mayor of Belgrade, Ljubomir Davidović"
 ww1_serbia.6.a:0 "Nobody wants Republic right now"
 ww1_serbia.7.t:0 "End the Pig war?"
 ww1_serbia.7.d:0 "Pig war has been in force for over half a decade by now. We are absolutely certain that it had no effect on Serbian economy and even produced the counter effect by forcing them to industrialize. Their economy not only that has not suffered a bit but has even improved under our sanctions. They fully escaped our economic control we worked so hard to implement in the last decades under Obrenović dynasty and Serbian government has found more places to trade and are no longer dependant on our trade. Unlike them, our economy has suffered from not having our little neighbour as trade partner. Now, we can finally end this vanity project once and for all, though we will have to be prepared for Serbian counter offer however it may be..."
 ww1_serbia.7.a:0 "End the embargo"
 ww1_serbia.7.b:0 "It will have desired effect eventually"
 ww1_serbia.8.t:0 "Prime Minister Resigns"
 ww1_serbia.8.d:0 "As we have only 1 deputy over majority, this slim majority makes the current government very unstable. Since we had to start rapproachment with radical dissidents who betrayed us few months ago, a lot of the radical party didn't like the move, including the current prime minister that took the position after dr Milovanović passed away. Therefore he resigned from the position and the government mandate will be given to the leader of People's Radical party, Nikola Pašić."
 ww1_serbia.8.a:0 "He will lead us to liberation of our long lost territories"
 ww1_serbia.9.t:0 "Dr Milovan Đ. Milovanović dies"
 ww1_serbia.9.d:0 "Prime Minister dr Milovan Đ. Milovanović has passed away today in his 49th year. He was the single biggest contributor to the alliance with Bulgaria that got expanded into now known as Balkan League. His deeds will never get forgotten. He dedicated his last years into foreign policy of Radical governments. He was the foreign minister in most of the recent governments and his biggest life achievement he will never see come into fruition. As Nikola Pašić is in Russia right now, Milija will be replaced by his interior minister Marko Trifković who vowed to uphold his legacy and make his project to it's fullest potential by liberating the Balkans, either he or his successor. "
 ww1_serbia.9.a:0 "Goodbye Milija... Your deeds will be remembered for centuries..."
 ww1_serbia.10.t:0 "Stojanović kicked out of the Independent Radical party"
 ww1_serbia.10.d:0 "Following his refusal to take the interim mandate, conflict sprayed in Independent Radical party. Allegedly, most of the party got dissatisfied by it's leader, his party considers his refusal to take mandate as huge blow to his party and Supreme council voted for his removal as both the head and member of the party. He will be replaced by the former mayor of Belgrade Ljubomir Davidović who has mostly more moderate ideas than his staunchly republican predcessor."
 ww1_serbia.10.a:0 "Interesting development"
 ww1_serbia.11.t:0 "Coalition Crisis!"
 ww1_serbia.11.d:0 "Our fragile coalition made up of both radical parties, biggest parties in Serbia by now is already showing some cracks. Namely, after smaller scandal in Ministry of Public Economy, Stojan Protić and his counterpart minister from coalition, Jaša Prodanović, the two people that kept coalition together, have resigned. We expect that most of the government will follow suite in the next weeks. As radicals still have comfortable majority, they are able to form homogenous government, pushing their coalition partners back into opposition. Only time will tell, as this instabillity might provoke our enormous northern and western neighbour into action."
 ww1_serbia.11.a:0 "This will end badly..."
 ww1_serbia.12.t:0 "Radical Victory in 1912 Elections"
 ww1_serbia.12.d:0 "Elections were held few days ago. After recounting the votes the winner is People's Radical party of Nikola Pašić. As expected mandate will be given to the former prime minister Milovanović as extension of his previous mandate. His alliance with Bulgaria, successful previous Radical mandates and all of the promises from heated electoral campaign contributed greatly to the success of Radicals. Milovanović has in public address after victory ensured that he will do everything in his power to see his biggest creation come into fruition by liberating all of the Balkans against 5 centuries of Turkish rule. Government will face new odds and first one of them would be the status in the parliament since they are just 1 deputy above majority and Radicals will need to ensure bigger support"
 ww1_serbia.12.a:0 "Congratulations!"
 ww1_serbia.13.t:0 "Independent Radical Victory in 1912 Elections"
 ww1_serbia.13.d:0 "Elections were held few days ago. After recounting the votes the winner is Independent Radical party of Ljubomir Stojanović. After consultations with king Peter I, mandate will be given to the party leader. The failures of the previous government, the disappointment regarding alliance with Bulgaria and of Annexation Crisis where Radical government lost Bosnia for the foreseable future contributed greatly to the Radical party's fail in these elections. As expected Stojanović has already expressed the need to deal with eastern neighbour and to fix the multiple problems that plagued recent Radical governments. Though even general direction of his mandate is unsure, his disapproval of monarchy as a system could play a great influence on the future of Independent Radical party and Serbia in whole."

As a result Austria has closed it's borders for Serbian import and export. Since main Serbian export was livestock, particularly the pigs, this trade war got named as Pig war. \nIt forced Serbian government to look outwards for exports, but unlike when exporting to Austria, Serbian nation can't export alive livestock so the trade war forced Serbian government to finally start industrialization.
